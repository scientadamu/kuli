Start the project (client)

This repository contains a Vite + React frontend in `client/`.

Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended >= 16)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\kuli\client
npm install
```

2. Run the development server (local):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\kuli\client
npm run dev
```

- The app will usually be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Build for production and preview:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\kuli\client
npm run build
npm start    # runs `vite preview` to serve the built files
```

Notes

- The `client/package.json` uses Vite (`dev`, `build`, `start` scripts).
- If you need me to also add a single-command helper script (PowerShell `.ps1`) or set up an npm workspace, tell me and I'll add it.
